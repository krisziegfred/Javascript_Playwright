# Javascript Playwright Automation

This repository contains end-to-end UI and API automation tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with JavaScript.  
**Links and additional documentation are also available in this GitHub repository.**

## 1. Functional UI Automation

- **Framework:** Playwright with JavaScript
- **Scenarios Covered:**
  - Login to the application
  - Scan available items from the list
  - Add an item to the cart
  - Verify the item inside the cart (existence check)
  - Checkout the item in the cart
  - Verify order confirmation
  - Verify order ID is correct
- **Notes:**  
  Edit and Delete functionalities are not covered due to time constraints, but can be easily added.

## 2. API Test Automation

- **Tools Used:** Postman and Playwright
- **Scenarios Covered:**
  - Login – `POST`
  - Add item to cart – `POST`
  - Create an order – `POST`
  - Retrieve items from the list of orders – `GET`
- **Notes:**  
  `PUT` and `DELETE` operations are not included due to time constraints, but are straightforward to implement.

## 3. Test Plan & Documentation

- **Strategy:**  
  Focus on covering the most important functionalities of the application with end-to-end automated tests.
- **Coverage:**
  - Major functionalities are tested.
  - Edit and Delete are not covered due to time constraints.
- **Tools Used:**  
  Playwright (free, powerful, and reduces flaky tests with built-in features).
- **How to Run the Tests:**  
  See [How to Run the Automated Tests](#how-to-run-the-automated-tests) below.

## 4. Bonus

- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  Test scripts can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines using YAML files with tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Azure DevOps.
- **Visual Test Snapshots:**  
  Not recommended due to potential issues with pixel differences, browser sizes, and headless mode in pipelines.
